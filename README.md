##Midterm 2

####Aim of the project:
1. derive demensionless differential equations that describe the radial mass distriubution inside a white dwarf star
1. write program that sovles equations with central denisty = 10
1. plot density vs radius
1. write program that solves equations with central density .08 - 1000000
1. plot dependence of radius of white dwarf vs its mass

* note max effecient velocity for R=10, glider scrubs speed by looping until reaching steady glide

![HW8 problem 2](https://github.com/SteveShaw-phys2200/Homework08/blob/master/glider-angle.png)

* note glider has greatest range with slightly negitive launch angle, intial velocity + lift is directed best down range under these conditions

* note once glider srubs bit of speed it enters steady dive
