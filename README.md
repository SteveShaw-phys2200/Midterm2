##Midterm 2

####Aim of the project:
1. derive demensionless differential equations that describe the radial mass distriubution inside a white dwarf star
1. write program that sovles equations with central denisty = 10
1. plot density vs radius
1. write program that solves equations with central density .08 - 1000000
1. plot dependence of radius of white dwarf vs its mass
